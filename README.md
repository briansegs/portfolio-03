## About the app:

I needed a portfolio to display my current web development work and wanted to take on more challenges as a Front-End web developer. I wanted to build a multi-page website, design my UI/UX, create all the artwork, use new technologies like Next.js and particles, create interesting animations and effects, and have fully functioning features like sending emails through a contact form. This is a big step up for me but I have been studying a lot and I learn best by challenging myself through projects.

### The skills I learned after completing this project:

- React functional components and their reusability
- Next.js fundamentals
- Next.js file and folder structure
- Next.js routing
- Fundamental CSS properties to improve my flex & grid skills
- Practice styling with Tailwindcss
- Animations and gradients
- Advanced Animations with Framer-motion
- Practice with Media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices
- Particles with tsparticles
- React-email and nodemailer
- Sentry for error reporting

## Technologies:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- Particle effects with [tsParticles](https://particles.js.org/)
- Styling with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Advanced animations with [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- Emails with [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) and [react email](https://react.email/)
- Error reporting with [sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)

## Setup:

Clone the project and enter its root directory.

Install **Node.js** -> [Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

### `npm i`

Installs all of the project's dependencies.

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Approach:

Because I wasn't working from a Figma design I needed to compile enough inspiration through sketches and images from the web to know what to build. Next, I created a basic Next.js app and set up the routing and file structure. After that, I added some basic styles to my CSS file that I knew I would be resuing. I built each section in the order they appear on the website, tweaking their responsiveness as I went and creating artwork in Photoshop as needed. The design was more loose so I made a lot of design changes as I went. There was also a lot of experimenting with different technologies to get the result I wanted. This was true for setting up the animations and email. This involved a lot of reading the documentation and trying things out. Lastly, I set up Sentry and deployed the site to Vercel's servers.

## Status:

This project is finished but will continue to be developed and updated.
